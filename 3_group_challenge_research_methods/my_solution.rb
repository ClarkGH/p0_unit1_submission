# HINT: Use puts statements to see if you are altering the original structure with these methods. 

# I want my method to return a list of words that contain a letter
my_array_finding_method(i_want_pets, "t") #=> should return ["want","pets","but"]

# I want my method to return a list of pet names by age

#I want this method to alter the actual structure.

# I've want more pets! I want to add one to every number in the structure.
my_array_modification_method(i_want_pets, 1)
